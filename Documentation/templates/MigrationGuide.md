# Master

*** Work In Progress ‚Äî Will be consolidated once the release is ready ***

Breaking:

* #420: Removed Swift 2 templates. Because it's old.
* IB #423: Renamed `storyboards` to `ib`, so user template search paths changed.
* XCAssets #453: All groups are no longer namespaced by default. To enable behaviour again: `forceProvidesNamespaces`
* #409: All templates now have `swiftlint:disable all` at the top, so you no longer need to ignore the generated files, although this is still recommended.
* #416 and #475: new Stencil/StencilSwiftKit, so new features for template writers.
* XCAssets #480: no longer generate `allXXX` constants by default. Can be turned on again with `allValues` flag.
* XCAssets #480: removed `noAllValues` parameter, replaced by `allValues` parameter.
* XCAssets #482: removed deprecated `allValues` constant
* XCAssets #482: changed x-platform image alias default from `Image` to `AssetImageTypeAlias`.
* IB #419: Split up the templates into one for scenes and one for segues (in preparation for future templates for accessibility labels, ...).
* IB #419: Added a handy initializer on `SegueType` for use in `prepareForSegue`.

Improvements:

* IB #485: Templates now handle the "Inherit module from target", you may not need the `--param  module=...` anymore.
* Fonts #394: Added a `registerAllCustomFonts` function.
* XCAssets #444: `NSDataAsset` support.

# Templates 2.1 Migration Guide

## Functionality changes in 2.1 (SwiftGen 5.1)

### XCAssets

The static `allValues` constant has been deprecated in favor of the `allImages` and `allColors` constants. This is because we've added support for named colors in asset catalogs.

# Templates 2.0 Migration Guide

If you're moving from SwiftGen 4.x to SwiftGen 5.0, you'll need to be aware that some templates have been renamed, removed or merged with others. Follow this Migration Guide to use the new name for SwiftGen 5.x of the templates you were previously using with SwiftGen 4.x.

## Deprecated templates in 2.0 (SwiftGen 5.0)

The two general themes for this version are:

- Templates now reside in the subfolder corresponding to their subcommand (`colors`, `fonts`, ...) instead of the filename being prefixed with it.
- The `default` template doesn't exist anymore, templates now specify which swift version they support.

Below is a list of renamed ("‚û°Ô∏è") and removed ("‚ùå") templates, grouped by subcommand. If your template hasn't been renamed or removed, you don't need to do anything ("‚úÖ"). You still might want to review the documentation for that template, as there might be new features you may be interested in.

### Colors

| Old | New | Reason |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| `default` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift2` | |
| `rawvalues` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | Seldomly used |
| `swift3` | ‚úÖ `swift3` | |

### Fonts

| Old | New | Reason |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| `default` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift2` | |
| `swift3` | ‚úÖ `swift3` | |

### Images / XCAssets

| Old | New | Reason |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| `allvalues` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift2`/`swift3` | All templates by default now generate an `allValues` static constant |
| `default` | ‚ö†Ô∏è `swift2` | Now integrates the recursive features of the previously named `dot-syntax` template |
| `dot-syntax` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift2` | |
| `dot-syntax-swift3` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift3` | |
| `swift3` | ‚ö†Ô∏è `swift3` | Now integrates the recursive features of the previously named `dot-syntax-swift3` template |

‚ö†Ô∏è The `images` subcommand from SwiftGen 4.x has been renamed `xcassets` in SwiftGen 5.0, so be sure to put those templates in a `xcassets` subfolder and not an `images` subfolder.

### Storyboards

| Old | New | Reason |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| `default` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift2` | |
| `lowercase` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | No longer needed since we prefix classes with their module |
| `osx-default` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift2` | Unified with the iOS template, just use `swift2` |
| `osx-lowercase` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | No longer needed since we prefix classes with their module |
| `osx-swift3` | ‚û°Ô∏è `swift3` | Unified with the iOS template, just use `swift3` |
| `swift3` | ‚ö†Ô∏è `swift3` | You'll probably need to adapt your call sites. See below. |
| `uppercase` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | No longer needed since we prefix classes with their module |

### Strings

| Old | New | Reason |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| `default` | ‚û°Ô∏è `flat-swift2` | |
| `dot-syntax` | ‚û°Ô∏è `structured-swift2` | |
| `dot-syntax-swift3` | ‚û°Ô∏è `structured-swift3` | |
| `genstrings` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | Seldomly used |
| `no-comments-swift3` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | The other templates now support a `noComments` parameter |
| `structured` | ‚ùå _deleted_ | Deprecated by `dot-syntax` (now called `structured-swift2/3`) |
| `swift3` | ‚û°Ô∏è `flat-swift3` | |

## Functionality changes in 2.0 (SwiftGen 5.0)

### Storyboards

You'll probably notice that your old codebase won't work with the new generated code. This is because we use a new, swiftier way of generating types for storyboard scenes. What it boils down to is that, if you had the following line in your code base:

```swift
StoryboardScene.Message.instantiateMessageList()
```

It should now become:

```swift
StoryboardScene.Message.messageList.instantiate()
```

üí° Tip: to help you do this transition, you may be interested in using the ["compatibility template"](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/wiki/SwiftGen-5.0-Migration:-compatibility-template) we suggest here. It will allow you to generate compatibility code for the old storyboard function calls, generating **depreciation warnings + renaming fix-its** for that SwiftGen 4.x API. This way you could then **use Xcode's "Fix all in scope" feature** to let Xcode do the renaming and migration for you!
